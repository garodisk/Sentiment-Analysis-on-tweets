This problem is taken from Analytics Vidhya's open Hackathon contest.

Introduction :

Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. Brands can use this data to measure the success of their products in an objective manner. In this challenge, I will be working with twitter data to predict sentiment on electronic products of netizens.

Problem Statement :

Sentiment analysis remains one of the key problems that has seen extensive application of natural language processing. This time around, given the tweets from customers about various tech firms who manufacture and sell mobiles, computers, laptops, etc, the task is to identify if the tweets have a negative sentiment towards such companies or products.
